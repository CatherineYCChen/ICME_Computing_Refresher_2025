# Computing at Stanford
In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to access the various computing resources at Stanford. Specifically we will talk about:
1. Connecting to Wifi
2. Two-Factor Authentication
3. Stanford Computing Clusters
4. Miscellaneous Resources

## Connecting to Wifi 
If you haven't done this already, the first thing you will probably want to do is connect to the Wifi at Stanford. 
There are a few different networks on campus with different purposes:
1. Stanford Visitor - Open to anyone, accept agreement to connect
2. Stanford - General network, requires SUID login
3. Stanford Secure - Secure network, requires installing Stanford security configuration
4. Eduroam - For people visiting campus, you can use at other universities
5. Stanford Residences - Use in residences

I recommend using Stanford or Stanford Secure, but some people use Stanford Visitor because there is no login or software involved. For now, try connecting to Stanford Visitor or Stanford and you can try connecting to Stanford Secure after class, since that requires some more work. This link will give you information about all of the networks:

## Two-Factor Authentication
When you log onto most Stanford services, you will need to use two-factor authentication to log in. This website gives the information on how to set everything up: https://uit.stanford.edu/service/authentication/twostep
But to summarize, you can put in your phone number to set up the following methods of authentication:
1. Duo Mobile push notification
2. Duo Mobile passcode
3. Phone call
4. SMS text message

While all of these methods work, I strongly recommend getting the Duo Mobile app on your phone, as I find the push notifications the easiest and most consistent because they do not require typing in a code or phone service.

## AFS 
https://afs.stanford.edu/
AFS stands for Andrew File System. 
It is an internal file system that you can use to store files that is accessible from Farmshare. 
For general file storing, I would use Box or Drive.
Putting files in the WWW folder makes them accessible from your website. index.html will function as this.

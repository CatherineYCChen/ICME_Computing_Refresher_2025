* Connecting to Wifi 
https://uit.stanford.edu/service/wirelessnet
If you haven't done this already, the first thing you will probably want to do is connect to the Wifi at Stanford. 
There are a few different networks on campus:
1. Stanford Visitor - Open to anyone, accept agreement to connect
2. Stanford - General network, requires SUID login
3. Stanford Secure - Secure network, requires installing Stanford security configuration
4. Eduroam - For people visiting campus, you can use at other universities
5. Stanford Residences - Use in residences

I recommend using Stanford or Stanford Secure overall. For now, use Stanford or Stanford Visitor and setting up what you want later.

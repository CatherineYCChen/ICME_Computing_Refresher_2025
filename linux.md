# Introduction to Linux/Unix

## What are Unix/Linux?
Linux and Unix are both operating systems. Unix was originally developed by AT&T Bell Labs and is a proprietary operating system that is used mainly in servers and mainframes today. It primarily involes the command line interface and is designed to work with specific hardware. As Unix was being developed, many competing versions with similar philosophies were developed as well. Linux is an open source operating system based on Unix, but not directly decended from it. Mac OS, is a descendant of the BSD family of Unix. Linux uses both command line interfaces and GUIs and is compatible with most hardware. Since Linux is open source, anyone can go into the code any modify it for whatever they want. Because of this, there are a number of different Linux distributions or versions of the Linux operating systems. Some examples are
* Redhat
* Debian
* ArchLinux
* Ubuntu
* CentOS
* Fedora
* Mint

Now although Linux and Unix are different, from a user's perspective, they are about the same. The commands for both are nearly the same. POSIX standards mean that Unix software will work on Linux. Hence, I will use the terms interchangeably.

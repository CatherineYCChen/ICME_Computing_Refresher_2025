A little bit more about each class in case you are unsure of what will be the best fit. Note that this might not be a 100% perfect characterization on each class, but based on course reviews online/talking to people. It is best to reach out to the TAs for a particular course if you are unsure or want more information!!!! You can always shop around classes for the first few weeks before committing to anything.
- CS 106B: is a good introductory programming class to take (it might assume some rudimentary programming knowledge but goes over a lot of essential foundational topics). An okay replacement for 211/212 (although 212 covered more topics for sure). 
- CME 213 is advanced, i.e. you need to know a fair amount of C++ before taking. There is no time at the beginning to learn it (the focus is on parallelization, not C++ coding practices), so definitely take a C++ course before enrolling in this. This parallel class is good for you if you are into scientific computing/ HPC.
- CME 323 has lots of topics, and doesn't go into as much depth with all of them. If you are more of an algorithms/ theoretical person, this seems like a good fit!
- CS 149 is probably good for you if you have a strong background in CS. Note that CS111: Operating Systems Principles is strong prerequisite for CS149, so check the course website for more information. This goes through more of a hardware perspective than CME 213. 
- CS 161 is a good foundational course for learning important algorithms. Suggests CS 106B as a prerequisit, so important to be a little familiar with coding. This has intro material for CME305/CS261, so good idea to take beforehand. 
- CS 166 has great reviews, and is probably an ok substitute for material covered in CME 212. Emphasis on gets good reviews!!!!! Data structures is also just an essential programming course to take, but won't have emphasis on scientific computing that CME211/212 had.
- CS 168 seems like it goes through a lot of algorithms but not into much depth. Seems like not much previous programming is required? One review said it would be nice to have probability/statistics background.
- CS 190 requires an application, and has a prereq of CS 140 (operating systems). Definitely a course for strong/experienced programmers.
- CS 194 is a group project based course and gives you a TON of freedom. Probably best if you have a project idea in mind (not a lot of instruction).
- CS 246 is a great class if you are using large datasets and want to learn tools to help with that. Lots of topics covered and "challenging hw assignments". Not an intro class but not extremely rigorous programming wise.
- CS 295 is a smaller course and has very mixed reviews. Not an introductory class, but unclear how intensive the assignments are.
- CS 315B is a good class to learn parallel strategies (Legion/Regent). Offered every other year! Project based class.
- CS 316/341 have not been offered in a few years and not sure when they will offer again...

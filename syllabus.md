### Overview

This course is intended to introduce students to the computing tools available at Stanford.
First, we will cover how to use connect to and use Stanford computing tools such as the Wi-Fi, computing clusters, and software.
Then, we will introduce basic usage of the Linux console and Bash scripting.
Next, we will dicuss commonly used computing tools such as MATLAB, Git, and LaTeX.
Finally, we will briefly show students some additional useful software and languages commonly used by ICME students such as Jupyter notebooks, Mathematica, Sublime Text, and others.

A list of topics is as follows:

* Computing at Stanford
  * Stanford wi-fi, two-factor authentication, and virtual private network (VPN)
  * Software liscening and printing on campus
  * Connecting to Stanford computing clusters
  * Accessing programs on the cluster
  * Other resources
* Linux and Bash scripting
  * Navigating the Linux environment
  * SLURM job submission
* Git
  * Basic git commands
  * Creating git projects
  * Using and modifying existing git projects

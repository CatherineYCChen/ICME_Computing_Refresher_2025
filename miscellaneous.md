# Miscellaneous
This is just a place where I wanted to plug a few useful tools and resources that are useful for a variety of computing needs.

## Slack
[Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/) is a chat and collaboration application. Many research groups (and companies) use it, and ICME has one too. I highly recommend joining the ICME Slack (if in ICME).

## Markdown
https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

Markdown is the language this document is written in. It is an easy way to write nice looking documents. It is not the got to language for writing papers or anything like that, but it is easy and quick to learn and it is useful for writing simple documents and typing notes.

## Julia
https://julialang.org/

Julia is a language that was designed from scratch for high performance and high programmer efficiency. The syntax is very similar to Matlab in its simplicity, but its performance can be nearly as good as C. In addition to all of this, it is open-source and free. This language has been gaining a lot of traction in computational math circles, like ICME, in recent years and version 1.0 was just released in August, so the language is now stable and the syntax will not change. The language is very useful and powerful and I believe it will be one of the most popular languages in the future. However at the moment, there is a lack of documentation and it can be difficult to figure out how to resolve some error messages.

## Mendeley
https://www.mendeley.com/

Menedeley is a reference management tool. It allows you to document the papers you have downloaded, organize them, generate citations, and it will even suggest related papers that you might be interested in.  I find it much easier than trying to organize all the pdfs into different folder and to remember what papers I want to cite where.

## Jupyter Notebooks
http://jupyter.org/

Jupyter notebooks are an opensource tool that allows you to write code in an interactive, notebook environment. In my mind, it is mainly used for Python and Julia, but there are also kernels that you can install to use it with pretty much any language. They also allow you to switch between Markdown and code, which makes it easy to clearly document your code. A lot of students use this every day for writing code and analyzing data.

## Mathematica
https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/

Mathematica is a symbolic mathematical computing language. It is very useful for solving complex problems analytically. For example, I often used it to solve complex systems of ODEs to check my numerical solutions. It also can produce very nice visualizations. Although it is not the focus of the language, numerical calcuations are also possible. In additon to all of the uses I mentioned, it has tons of built in funcitonality or applications from data analysis to numer theory. Unfortunately, Mathematica is not free. Stanford has licenses on computer lab computers and Farmshare, so it is accessible there, but if you want it on your personal computer, you will have to pay for a student license. Additionally, the language is very rigid and can be frustrating to learn the syntax of at first. However, I believe Mathematica is a very powerful tool that is worth being able to use if the need comes up. Also, as an added bonus, if you are using Mathematica and have access to the internet, you can type `==` and then it will enter Wolfram Alpha mode and you can ask question like you would in Wolfram Alpha and it will show steps!

## Scientific Computing Courses at Stanford
Here are a list of scientific computing courses at Stanford:
* CME 211 - Basics of Python and C++
* CME 212 - Scientific computing with C++
* CME 213 - Parallel computing (with an emphasis on CUDA)
* CME 214 - Modern Fortran
* CME 323 - Distributed Algorithms
* CME 342 - Parallel methods in numerical analysis
* CS 315b - Regent/Legion and other modern parallel computing languages
* ME 344  - General introduction to high performance computing clusters and programming paradigms
* CME 192 - Short course on introduction to Matlab
* CME 195 - Introduction to R
* CME 257 - Short course on Julia
* CME 292 - Short course on advanced MATLAB

This is not a complete list. Of course, the CS department in particular offers several other courses that may be of interest.

## Stack Overflow
Have a programming-related question that can't be answered? You can likely find an answer here: https://stackoverflow.com, or ask a question yourself. https://math.stackexchange.com/ is a similar site for mathematics questions.

## arXiv
Most of you are probably familiar with this, but [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is an online archive for scientific research papers and preprints, with a particular emphasis on the mathematical and computational fields. ([biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) is a similar site more geared towards biological disciplines.)

## LeetCode
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is a site for practicing coding problems, particularly interview-style questions. Very useful for those of you considering a career in tech.

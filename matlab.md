# Introduction to MATLAB

## What is MATLAB?
MATLAB is short for "Matrix Laboratory." It is a scripting language that is designed for fast matrix operations and to be full of features for scientific computing. The software is proprietary and requires a license, so it is not free. Stanford offers discount licenses for personal use though the software store, free access on Farmshare, and free access in computer labs. For similar, free options, you can try out Octave, Python (with NumPy and SciPy), R, or Julia.

## Basics
* `x = 5` - Variables are defined with `=`
* `+` `-` `*` `/` - Basic math operations
* `==`, `<` `<=`, `~=` - Logical operations
* `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `exp(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, `round(x)` - Math functions
* `pi`, `i`, `Inf` - Special values
* `;` - At the end of lines suppresses output
* `%` - Comment
* `help <function>` - Show function documentation
* `clear` - Clears all saved variables (useful at the beginning of scripts)
* `clc` - Clears the command window (useful at the beginning of scripts)
* `close all` - Closes all figure (useful at hte beginning of scripts)

# Class 1 Exercises

For our exercises today, we want to make sure that you can connect to the Farmshare with X11 forwarding. We will use this next class to play around with Linux. If you don't have your computer in class or miss the first day, please try to do this before the next class. (Although you can still come to class tomorrow if you don't finish this. You just might not be able to do the exercises.) 

1. Connect to Stanford or Stanford Secure wifi. 
2. Download an SSH and/or X11 client 
3. Connect to rice@stanford.edu

# Class 1 Exercises

For our exercises today, we want to make sure that you can connect to the Farmshare with X11 forwarding. Also try get yourself familiar with the basic Linux commands we went through today.

We will use this next class to play around with Git usage and some other softwares. If you don't have your computer in class or miss the first class, please try to do this on your own time (this repository will be distributed). 

1. Connect to Stanford wifi (or VPN if off campus). 
2. Download an SSH and/or X11 client if needed.
3. Connect to SUNetID@rice.stanford.edu.
4. Try the basic Linux commands.
5. Clone this repository to your directory (either on rice or back on your personal device). It is a useful resource for you to keep this repository somewhere to be able to look back on throughout your first year.  
   
   `git clone https://github.com/lreeder7/ICME_Computing_Refresher_2022.git`
   
   Don't worry if this command doesn't make sense to you right now.  We will go over covers git commands in our next section.
